# Chocolate Babka



## Ingredients

_Dough_

3 3/4 cup flour  [530g, 18.7oz]  
1/2 cup sugar  
1 tbl. instant yeast  
3 large eggs  
1/2 cup water  
3/4 tsp. salt  
2/3 cup butter, at room temperature, in small chunks  
oil for pan prep, extra flour for dusting  

_Filling_

1/2 cup sugar  
1/3 cup cocoa powder  
4 oz. dark chocolate, melted  
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted  
2/3 cup chocolate chips or pecans (optional)  

_Syrup_

1/2 cup water  
1/2 cup sugar  

## Directions

Mix the flour sugar and yeast in mixer bowl.  Mix in eggs and water until dough forms.
Add salt and then incrementally add the butter.  Knead about 10 minutes, until dough
is smooth and pulls away from sides, pausing to scrape down occasionally.

Oil the bowl/dough. Let rise in a cool place, ideally fridge overnight.

Grease two 9x4 inch loaf pans, line bottoms with parchment.

Make filling: mix sugar, cocoa, chocolate and butter into a smooth paste.
(can melt the butter and chocolate together).


Split dough in half, keep one half in fridge.

Roll dough out on lightly floured surface into 15x11 inch rectangle.

Arrange so that long side is closest to you.  Spread 1/2 of the
filling, leaving a small border.  Sprinkle half of the chips/nuts on the filling.

Roll the dough up working away from you.  Dampen the far edge and press to seal. (end up with 15" long log)

Starting 1/2" from the end, cut the roll in half lengthwise.
Twist the two parts so that the cut side faces up, then braid them
with one another.  Put into the loaf pan.
Repeat with the other half of dough and filling to form a second loaf.

Loosely cover and let rise 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 375F, rack in middle of oven.

Bake for 25-30 minutes, until skewer comes out clean.

While they bake, prepare the syrup: heat the water, dissolve sugar.

As soon as the bread comes out of the oven, brush syrup over them.
Use all of the syrup.

Stays fresh for a day, can be frozen.
